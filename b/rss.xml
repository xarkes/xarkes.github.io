<title>Making a Lineage 2 Bot</title>
<link>https://xarkes.com/b/making-a-lineage-2-bot.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
A few months ago I got nostalgic and wanted to try again a little bit of Lineage 2.
In the past most servers were filled with tons of bots that would farm
in order to either level up, gain money or loot materials useful for crafting equipment.
The working and available bots are all non-free (to my knowledge) and most of them are detected by the remote servers as cheating tools!
So I decided to make my own bot as I thought the process would be interesting.
This blog post presents my approach at making my own bot for Lineage II.

<title>Advent 2019 - Genetic Mutation writeup (First Blood)</title>
<link>https://xarkes.com/b/advent-2019-Genetic-Mutation-First-Blood.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
This month, I took a glance at <a href="https://overthewire.org">Over The Wire</a>
<a href="https://advent2019.overthewire.org">advent CTF</a>
with some of my teammates of <a href="https://securimag.org">Securimag</a>.
The challenge was asking for at most 4 bytes to patch and I found it sufficient
to exploit not the binary itself but rather the <code>exec</code> function. I don't know
if that was the intended way, but it was quick enough to pop a shell and get the
first blood.

<title>Hack.lu 2019 - Baby Kernel 2 writeup</title>
<link>https://xarkes.com/b/hacklu-2019-babykernel-wu.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[
Last october, I participated to <a href="https://2019.hack.lu/">Hack.lu</a> Capture The Flag with my team
<a href="https://securimag.org/">Securimag</a>.
I did this writeup as all the ones I've read do not explain how they managed to reliably find the offset of <code>real_cred</code> in the <code>current_task</code> structure.
