I started this sci-fi TV show, and couldn't help but prefer watching it over doing some more productive things. The good thing is that although the content of the show is getting less interesting and slower, I started feeling like I was spending 50 minutes watching episodes only to get 10 minutes of actual content, ending up on a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger>cliffhanger</a> and willing to jump into the next one.<p>I immediately thought I could code while watching the TV show, however my current situation involves only my laptop screen so it's tough to multitask. So what about showing my code on top of the video?</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p>My current setup for coding is the following:<ul><li>Window manager: <a href=https://awesomewm.org/>Awesome WM</a><li>Terminal emulator: <a href=https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty>alacritty</a><li>Text editor: <a href=https://helix-editor.com/>Helix</a></ul><p>So let's give it a try, and set alacritty's background opacity down:<pre class=language-toml data-lang=toml style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-toml data-lang=toml><span style=color:#65737e># ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml
</span><span>[window]
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>opacity </span><span>= </span><span style=color:#d08770>0
</span></code></pre><p>In order for this to take effect, a compositor is required. I don't usually have one running with Awesome WM, however any would do, for instance <a href=https://github.com/yshui/picom>picom</a>. Its default configuration should make the opacity configuration work.<p>Let's create a new Helix theme such that it has no background color, to use the terminal's background and be transparent too.<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a>mkdir -p ~</span><span>/.config/helix/themes
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>cat </span><span>>> </span><span style=color:#bf616a>~</span><span>/.config/helix/themes/translucid.toml <<</span><span style=color:#b48ead>EOF
</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>inherits = "dracula"
</span><span style=color:#a3be8c>"ui.background" = {}
</span><span style=color:#b48ead>EOF
</span></code></pre><p>The theme can now be loaded in Helix, and the background will be transparent. However, one issue remains: the text is still opaque.<p>I wonder if this is the best way, but I could easily change Alacritty's whole opacity using picom configuration.<pre class=language-ini data-lang=ini style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-ini data-lang=ini><span style=color:#65737e># ~/.config/picom/picom.conf
</span><span style=color:#65737e># [...]
</span><span>
</span><span style=color:#65737e># Make Alacritty windows opacity to 20%
</span><span style=color:#bf616a>opacity-rule </span><span>= [ </span><span style=color:#a3be8c>"20:class_g = 'Alacritty'"</span><span> ];
</span></code></pre><h2 id=result>Result</h2><p>That's it, I now have a perfectly transparent window on top of my video, with translucid text! It's not perfect as obviously the theme colors are fixed while the video image changes (eg. from black to white), but it's quite cool to be able to watch a video while writing code. Quite uncommon setup, but I find it quite cool, although I really believe multitasking doesn't help focusing and being actually efficient. But hey, it's Sunday, who cares about efficiency anyways?<p><img alt="A transparent terminal and text editor on top of a video" src=/img/ide_over.jpg></div></main><footer>2024 - Antide Petit aka <a href=https://xarkes.com>xarkes</a> - <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC-BY-SA</a> - Made with ❤️</footer>
