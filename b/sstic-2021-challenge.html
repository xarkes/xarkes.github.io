It was very painful and amongst 150 participants and over 1600 downloads, I managed to finish 4<sup>th</sup> in the speed ranking with only 12 people managing to complete the challenge. My solution (in French) can be found <a href=https://static.sstic.org/challenge2021/solutions/04_Antide_Petit.pdf>here</a> but as this year was the first time the challenge was open internationally, two solutions are available in English (the ones of Robert Xiao and ZetaTwo).</p><p>This year's challenge was crazy. It was required to extract files from an USB capture of an archive between an USB stick and a computer, then reverse engineer and exploit a Windows application exposed on a remote host, reverse engineer a virtual machine and defeat some bad encryption schemes, understand an unknown CPU in blackbox and finally exploit a linux driver vulnerability in order to take control of a PCI device connected on the machine.</p><p>Doing all of this was exhausting and very satisfying at the same time, and here is one of my favorite moment (except after just solving the challenge) that I captured in a moment of excitation thus I apologise for the quality:</p><p><img alt="Getting a shell on a remote Windows 10 computer" src=/static/img/sstic_2021_windows_win.jpg></p><p>If you wonder if you should participate in next year challenge, don't hesitate, just try it. It will require a lot of dedication to reach the end, but even if you don't, there are many things to learn along the way.</p></article><hr></main><footer> 2021 - Antide Petit aka <a href=/ >xarkes</a> - <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ >CC-BY-SA</a> - Made with ❤️ </footer></body></html>
